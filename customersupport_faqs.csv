What is your shipping policy and how long does shipping take?,"We offer free shipping on U.S. and Canadian orders over $38. We charge a flat shipping rate of $4.99 for orders below $38. Shipping generally takes 2-8 business days to all parts of the continental U.S. and 4-14 business days to Canada after being dispatched. Orders will take 1-2 business days to process before they are dispatched. Please note that we will always aim to quicken these timeframes significantly, but many aspects of shipping are out of our control. Please note we are unable to guarantee shipping timeframes. We do not provide refunds due to shipping exceptions/delays. For customers outside the USA, we also cannot guarantee that your order will not incur additional taxes, customs duties, or other fees. We will not reimburse customers who are subject to these fees, and we will not provide a refund for this reason. "
What is your return policy?,"Because of the nature of our product, and because customer safety is our top priority, we do not accept returns for products that have been opened from their original packaging. For general returns of unopened products, email us at customerservice@theradiantrhino.com within 24 hours of delivery (based on available tracking information).Refund requests made after this time period will not be accepted. To return an item, you must ship the product back to us in its original, unopened packaging without any damage or tampering.
